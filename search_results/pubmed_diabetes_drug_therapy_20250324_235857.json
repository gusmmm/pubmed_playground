      "abstract": "Drug-induced diabetes insipidus is always of the nephrogenic type, i.e. unresponsiveness of the kidneys to the action of antidiuretic hormone. This condition is easily diagnosed by measuring urinary concentrating capacity during a thirst test (e.g. 12 hours of water deprivation) or by administration of a modified antidiuretic hormone, desmopressin, to demonstrate the renal unresponsiveness. Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is not a common disorder except in patients receiving treatment with lithium salts for affective disorders where it may affect about 10% of patients treated long term (15 years). Drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by other drugs usually occurs in critically ill patients in intensive care units receiving a multitude of drugs dominated by antimicrobials and cytostatics. A search of the World Health Organization's adverse effect database revealed 359 reports of drug-induced diabetes insipidus. Lithium was the most common cause (159 reports) followed by foscarnet (15) and clozapine (10). Treatment is symptomatic in most patients and the offending drug should be stopped. If urine volumes exceed 4 L/day, treatment with thiazides and amiloride has been advocated, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, may be tried in severe cases. Prevention of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is an important aspect of the treatment of affective disorders. In patients treated long term it appears to be only partly reversible upon lithium discontinuation. Close monitoring of the treatment aiming at 12-hour trough value of 0.4 to 0.6 mmol/L is recommended. Yearly measurement of the urinary volume/day is effective in making both the patient and the physician aware of the development of the drug-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The condition is a serious adverse effect because of the risk of developing dehydration and aggravation of drug intoxications.

While not directly about treating diabetes mellitus, it highlights a significant adverse effect of other drug therapies, particularly lithium, and discusses management strategies for this specific type of diabetes insipidus. Further exploration should focus on the specific mechanisms by which these drugs induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, as understanding these mechanisms could inform the development of safer drug alternatives or preventative measures.\n"

      "abstract": "Diabetes insipidus, the inability to concentrate urine resulting in polyuria and polydipsia, can have different manifestations and management considerations in infants and children compared to adults. Central diabetes insipidus, secondary to lack of vasopressin production, is more common in children than is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the inability to respond appropriately to vasopressin. The goal of treatment in both forms of diabetes insipidus is to decrease urine output and thirst while allowing for appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia and ensuring an acceptable quality of life for each patient. An infant's obligate need to consume calories as liquid and the need for readjustment of medication dosing in growing children both present unique challenges for diabetes insipidus management in the pediatric population. Treatment modalities typically include vasopressin or thiazide diuretics. Special consideration must be given when managing diabetes insipidus in the adipsic patient, post-surgical patient, and in those undergoing chemotherapy or receiving medications that alter free water clearance.

      "abstract": "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine that results in polyuria and polydipsia, despite having normal or elevated plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). In this study, we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various etiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments. NDI has different clinical manifestations and approaches according to the etiology. Hereditary forms of NDI are mainly caused by mutations in the genes that encode key proteins in the AVP signaling pathway, while acquired causes are normally associated with specific drug exposure, especially lithium, and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary according to the degree of dehydration and hyperosmolality, being worse when renal water losses cannot be properly compensated by fluid intake. Regarding the diagnosis of NDI, it is important to consider the symptoms of the patient and the diagnostic tests, including the water deprivation test and the baseline plasma copeptin measurement, a stable surrogate biomarker of AVP release. Without proper treatment, patients may developcomplications leading to high morbidity and mortality, such as severe dehydration and hypernatremia. In that sense, the treatment of NDI consists in decreasing the urine output, while allowing appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia, and ensuring an acceptable quality of life. Therefore, therapeutic options include nonpharmacological interventions, including sufficient water intake and a low-sodium diet, and pharmacological treatment. The main medications used for NDI are thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and amiloride, used isolated or in combination.

The known causes include germinoma/craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases, trauma resulting from surgery or an accident, sarcoidosis, metastases and midline cerebral and cranial malformations. In rare cases, the underlying cause can be genetic defects in vasopressin synthesis that are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive traits. The diagnosis of the underlying condition is challenging and raises several concerns for patients and parents as it requires long-term follow-up. Proper etiological diagnosis can be achieved via a series of steps that start with clinical observations and then progress to more sophisticated tools. Specifically, MRI identification of pituitary hyperintensity in the posterior part of the sella, now considered a clear marker of neurohypophyseal functional integrity, together with the careful analysis of pituitary stalk shape and size, have provided the most striking findings contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of some forms of 'idiopathic' CDI. MRI STIR (short-inversion-time inversion recovery sequencing) is a promising technology for the early identification of LCH-dependent CDI. CI - Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

      "abstract": "Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterised by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI resulting from deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI) or AVP-resistance develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as in aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI, and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia, can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs and, in some cases, administration of diuretics. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI has led to novel evolving therapeutic agents that are under clinical trial. CI - (c) 2023 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.
