      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe burn injury causes significant metabolic changes and demands that make nutritional support particularly important. Feeding the severe burn patient is a real challenge in regard to the specific needs and the clinical constraints. This review aims to challenge the existing recommendations in the light of the few recently published data on nutritional support in burn patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Some key macro- and micro-nutrients have been recently studied in severe burn patients. Repletion, complementation or supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin C, vitamin D, antioxidant micronutrients may be promising from a physiologic perspective, but evidence of benefits on hard outcomes is still weak due to the studies' design. On the contrary, the anticipated positive effects of glutamine on the time to discharge, mortality and bacteremias have been disproved in the largest randomized controlled trial investigating glutamine supplementation in burns. An individualized approach in term of nutrients quantity and quality may proof highly valuable and needs to be validated in adequate trials. The combination of nutrition and physical exercises is another studied strategy that could improve muscle outcomes. SUMMARY: Due to the low number of clinical trials focused on severe burn injury, most often including limited number of patients, developing new evidence-based guidelines is challenging. More high-quality trials are needed to improve the existing recommendations in the very next future. CI - Copyright (c) 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with severe burn injuries pose significant challenges for the intensivist. Though average burn sizes have decreased over time, severe burn injuries involving greater than 20% of the total body surface area still occur. Verified burn centers are limited, making the management of severely burn injured patients at nonspecialized ICUs likely. Current practices in burn care have increased survivability even from massive burns. It is important for intensivists to be aware of the unique complications and therapeutic options in burn critical care management. This review critically discusses current practices and recently published data regarding the evaluation and management of severe burn injury. RECENT FINDINGS: Burn patients have long, complex ICU stays with accompanying multiorgan dysfunction. Recent advances in burn intensive care have focused on acute respiratory distress syndrome from inhalation injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and transfusion, resulting in new strategies for organ failure, including renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal life support. SUMMARY: Initial evaluation and treatment of acute severe burn injury remains an ongoing area of study. This manuscript reviews current practices and considerations in the acute management of the severely burn injured patient.

      "abstract": "Burns are the most extensive forms of soft tissue injuries occasionally resulting in extensive and deep wounds and death. Burns can lead to severe mental and emotional distress, because of excessive scarring and skin contractures. Treatment of burns has always been a difficult medical problem and many different methods have been used to treat such injuries, locally. Biofilms are a collection of microorganisms that delay wound healing. One of the new methods of prevention and treatment of burn wound infections is application of antimicrobials, which act on biofilms and prevent the wound infection. Biofilm initiates a persistent, low-grade, inflammatory response, impairing both the epithelialisation and granulation tissue formation. Skin grafts have been shown to dramatically reduce deaths from infection. However, grafting has considerable limitations. Such injuries are long-lasting and many patients suffer from chronic pain for a long time. Tissue engineering is a new approach in reducing the limitations of conventional treatments and producing a supply of immunologically tolerant artificial tissue, leading to a permanent solution for damaged tissues; such criteria make it a cost-effective and reliable treatment modality. To overcome the present limitations of burn wound healing, knowledge about the latest findings regarding healing mechanisms is important. Here the authors discuss the most important events regarding burn wound healing and review the latest treatment strategies that have been used for burn wounds from in vitro to clinical levels. Finally, we discuss the role of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in the future of burn wound healing, modelling and remodelling.

Calorie deficit, negative protein balance and antioxidant micronutrient deficiency after thermal injury have been associated to poor clinical outcomes. In this context, personalized nutrition therapy with early enteral feeding from the start of resuscitation are indicated. Over the last four decades, different nutritional and pharmacological interventions aimed at modulating the immune and metabolic responses have been evaluated. These strategies have been shown to be able to minimize acute malnutrition, as well as modulate the immunoinflammatory response, and improve relevant clinical outcomes in this patient population. The purpose of this updating review is to summarize the most current evidence on metabolic response and nutrition therapy in critically ill burn patients.

      "abstract": "Care of burn-injured patients requires knowledge of the pathophysiologic changes affecting virtually all organs from the onset of injury until wounds are healed. Massive airway and/or lung edema can occur rapidly and unpredictably after burn and/or inhalation injury. Hemodynamics in the early phase of severe burn injury is characterized by a reduction in cardiac output and increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Approximately 2 to 5 days after major burn injury, a hyperdynamic and hypermetabolic state develops. Electrical burns result in morbidity much higher than expected based on burn size alone. Formulae for fluid resuscitation should serve only as guideline; fluids should be titrated to physiologic endpoints. Burn injury is associated basal and procedural pain requiring higher than normal opioid and sedative doses. Operating room concerns for the burn-injured patient include airway abnormalities, impaired lung function, vascular access, deceptively large and rapid blood loss, hypothermia, and altered pharmacology.

The skin is the largest organ of the body and consequences of injury range of minor pain to severe end-organ dysfunction and even death. The acute assessment and management of burn-injured patients is a critical part of their short-term and long-term outcomes and often benefit from specialty, multidisciplinary care. Local wound care and appropriate excision and grafting are important parts of managing the functional, cosmetic, and physiologic derangements caused by burn injuries. Large burns also require judicious fluid resuscitation. Electrical, chemical, and inhalational injuries are less common than thermal burns but require additional care and are often associated with increased morbidity. CI - Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

      "abstract": "Burns are a common type of skin injury encountered at all levels of medical facilities from private clinics to core hospitals. Minor burns heal by topical treatment alone, but moderate to severe burns require systemic management, and skin grafting is often necessary also for topical treatment. Inappropriate initial treatment or delay of initial treatment may exert adverse effects on the subsequent treatment and course. Therefore, accurate evaluation of the severity and initiation of appropriate treatment are necessary. The Guidelines for the Management of Burn Injuries were issued in March 2009 from the Japanese Society for Burn Injuries as guidelines concerning burns, but they were focused on the treatment for extensive and severe burns in the acute period. Therefore, we prepared guidelines intended to support the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment for patients with burns that are commonly encountered including minor as well as moderate and severe cases. Because of this intention of the present guidelines, there is no recommendation of individual surgical procedures. CI - (c) 2016 Japanese Dermatological Association.
