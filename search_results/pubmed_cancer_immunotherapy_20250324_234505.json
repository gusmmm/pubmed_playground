      "abstract": "Immunotherapy has become a powerful clinical strategy for treating cancer. The number of immunotherapy drug approvals has been increasing, with numerous treatments in clinical and preclinical development. However, a key challenge in the broad implementation of immunotherapies for cancer remains the controlled modulation of the immune system, as these therapeutics have serious adverse effects including autoimmunity and nonspecific inflammation. Understanding how to increase the response rates to various classes of immunotherapy is key to improving efficacy and controlling these adverse effects. Advanced biomaterials and drug delivery systems, such as nanoparticles and the use of T cells to deliver therapies, could effectively harness immunotherapies and improve their potency while reducing toxic side effects. Here, we discuss these research advances, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cancer immunotherapy, and we critically analyse the outlook for these emerging areas.

      "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA, recently surpassing breast cancer. A key component of pancreatic cancer's lethality is its acquired immune privilege, which is driven by an immunosuppressive microenvironment, poor T cell infiltration, and a low mutational burden. Although immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade or engineered T cells have yet to demonstrate efficacy, a growing body of evidence suggests that orthogonal combinations of these and other strategies could unlock immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. In this Review article, we discuss promising immunotherapies currently under investigation in pancreatic cancer and provide a roadmap for the development of prevention vaccines for this and other cancers.

Many new cancer-specific immunotherapeutic drugs have gained approval in the past several years, demonstrating immunotherapy's efficacy and promise as an anticancer modality. Despite these successes, several outstanding questions remain for cancer immunotherapy, including how to make immunotherapy more efficacious in a broader range of cancer types and patients, and how to predict which patients will respond or not respond to therapy. We present a case for integrative systems approaches that will answer these questions. This involves applying mechanistic and statistical modeling, establishing consistent and widely adopted experimental tools to generate systems-level data, and creating sustained mechanisms of support. If implemented, these approaches will lead to major advances in cancer treatment. CI - Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

      "abstract": "Metastasis, which occurs when cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumor site to other parts of the body, is the primary cause of mortality in patients, and the recurrence of multiple metastatic tumors is an obstacle to eliminating cancer. Recent clinical studies demonstrated that patients who respond to immunotherapy have longer survival rates with lower metastatic relapse, suggesting that immunotherapy may be one of the solutions to overcome cancer metastasis. Indeed, various host immune cells not only shape the tumor microenvironment but also participate in multiple stages of metastasis. Therefore, to improve clinical outcome, it is critical to understand the immunological events associated with tumor development and progression. In this article, we summarize those events that are involved in tumor progression and discuss immunotherapies that can potentially target cancer metastasis.

However, there are subsets of patients across multiple cancers who have not shown robust responses to these agents. A major impediment to progress in the field is the availability of faithful mouse models that recapitulate the complexity of human malignancy and immune contexture within the tumor microenvironment. These models are urgently needed across all malignancies to interrogate and predict antitumor immune responses and therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials. Herein, we seek to review pros and cons of different cancer mouse models, and how they can be used as platforms to predict efficacy and resistance to cancer immunotherapies.Significance: Although immunotherapy has shown substantial benefit in the treatment of a variety of malignancies, a key hurdle toward the advancement of these therapies is the availability of immunocompetent preclinical mouse models that recapitulate human disease. Here, we review the evolution of preclinical mouse models and their utility as coclinical platforms for mechanistic interrogation of cancer immunotherapies. Cancer Discov; 8(11); 1358-65.

      "abstract": "Until now, three types of well-recognized cancer treatments have been developed, i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy; these either remove or directly attack the cancer cells. These treatments can cure cancer at earlier stages but are frequently ineffective for treating cancer in the advanced or recurrent stages. Basic and clinical research on the tumor microenvironment, which consists of cancerous, stromal, and immune cells, demonstrates the critical role of antitumor immunity in cancer development and progression. Cancer immunotherapies have been proposed as the fourth cancer treatment. In particular, clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, in various cancer types represents a major breakthrough in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, accumulating data regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate that these are not always effective but are instead only effective in limited cancer populations. Indeed, several issues remain to be solved to improve their clinical efficacy; these include low cancer cell antigenicity and poor infiltration and/or accumulation of immune cells in the cancer microenvironment. Therefore, to accelerate the further development of cancer immunotherapies, more studies are necessary. In this review, we will summarize the current status of cancer immunotherapies, especially cancer vaccines, and discuss the potential problems and solutions for the next breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy.

      "abstract": "TGFbeta signalling has key roles in cancer progression: most carcinoma cells have inactivated their epithelial antiproliferative response and benefit from increased TGFbeta expression and autocrine TGFbeta signalling through effects on gene expression, release of immunosuppressive cytokines and epithelial plasticity. As a result, TGFbeta enables cancer cell invasion and dissemination, stem cell properties and therapeutic resistance. TGFbeta released by cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and other cells in the tumour microenvironment further promotes cancer progression by shaping the architecture of the tumour and by suppressing the antitumour activities of immune cells, thus generating an immunosuppressive environment that prevents or attenuates the efficacy of anticancer immunotherapies. The repression of TGFbeta signalling is therefore considered a prerequisite and major avenue to enhance the efficacy of current and forthcoming immunotherapies, including in tumours comprising cancer cells that are not TGFbeta responsive. Herein, we introduce the mechanisms underlying TGFbeta signalling in tumours and their microenvironment and discuss approaches to inhibit these signalling mechanisms as well as the use of these approaches in cancer immunotherapies and their potential adverse effects.

The clinical goal of cancer immunotherapy is to prime host immune system to provide passive or active immunity against malignant tumors. Tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) play an immunomodulatory role in tumor microenvironment (TME) which is closely related to immune escape of tumor cells, thus influence tumor progress. Several cancer immunotherapies, include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cancer vaccine, adoptive cell transfer (ACT), have shown great efficacy and promise. In this review, we will summarize the recent research advances in tumor immunotherapy, including the molecular mechanisms and clinical effects as well as limitations of immunotherapy.

The clinical efficacy of conventional therapies is limited, and the median overall survival (mOS) for advanced-stage gastric cancer is only about 8 months. Emerging as one of breakthroughs for cancer therapy, immunotherapy has become an effective treatment modality after surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. In this review, we have summarized the progresses of clinical development of immunotherapies for gastric cancer. Major advances with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have started to change the clinical practice for gastric cancer treatment and prognosis. Additionally, combination therapies with other modalities, such as targeted therapies, are expected to push immunotherapies to front-line. In this review, the efficacy of ICIs and targeted therapy alone or combination with existing therapies gastric cancer treatment was described and the predictive value of biomarkers for immunotherapies in gastric cancer treatment is also discussed.

      "abstract": "Immunotherapy has greatly improved outcomes for subgroups of patients with cancer. As indications keep expanding, there is an unmet need to gain a better understanding of the effect of these therapies on pregnancy and fertility. During pregnancy, substantial adaptations occur in the maternal immune system to maintain protection against pathogens while avoiding detrimental reactions to the semi-allogeneic fetus. The pathways involved in the establishment of this fetomaternal tolerance can be hijacked by cancers. Immunotherapies that target these inhibitory pathways, or that directly interact with the regulatory immune cells involved in tolerance mechanisms, might therefore result in complications during pregnancy. Similarly, by activating the patient's immune system with immunotherapy, a broad range of immune-related adverse events can occur that could negatively affect the fetus or impede a future desired pregnancy. This Review summarises preclinical and clinical data related to the use of immunotherapy during pregnancy, including all approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, recombinant cytokines, cell therapies, vaccines, and immunomodulatory drugs.

      "abstract": "Anticancer immunotherapies involving the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive cellular transfer have emerged as new therapeutic pillars within oncology. These treatments function by overcoming or relieving tumour-induced immunosuppression, thereby enabling immune-mediated tumour clearance. While often more effective and better tolerated than traditional and targeted therapies, many patients have innate or acquired resistance to immunotherapies. Cancer immunoediting is the process whereby the immune system can both constrain and promote tumour development, which proceeds through three phases termed elimination, equilibrium and escape. Throughout these phases, tumour immunogenicity is edited, and immunosuppressive mechanisms that enable disease progression are acquired. The mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy seem to broadly overlap with those used by cancers as they undergo immunoediting to evade detection by the immune system. In this Review, we discuss how a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cancer immunoediting process can provide insight into the development of resistance to immunotherapies and the strategies that can be used to overcome such resistance.

This involves the stimulation of the immune system to control tumor growth and it specifically targets the neoplastic cells rather than the normal cells. Conventional chemotherapy has many limitations which include drug resistance, recurrence of cancer and severe adverse effects. Immunology has made major treatment breakthroughs for several cancers such as colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia etc. Currently, therapeutic strategies harnessing the immune system involve Checkpoint inhibitors, Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells), Monoclonal antibodies, Cancer vaccines, Cytokines, Radio-immunotherapy and Oncolytic virus therapy. The molecular characterization of several tumor antigens (TA) indicates that these TA can be utilized as promising candidates in cancer immunotherapy strategies. Here in this review, we highlight and summarize the different categories of emerging cancer immunotherapies along with the immunologically recognized tumor antigens involved in the tumor microenvironment.

Various immunotherapies based on CD8(+) T cells have emerged in recent decades, showing their promising results in treating intractable diseases. However, in the fight against the constantly changing and evolving cancers, the formation and function of CD8(+) T cells can be challenged by tumors that might train a group of accomplices to resist the T cell killing. As cancer therapy stepped into the era of immunotherapy, understanding the physiological role of CD8(+) T cells, studying the machinery of tumor immune escape, and thereby formulating different therapeutic strategies become the imperative missions for clinical and translational researchers to fulfill. After brief basics of CD8(+) T cell-based biology is covered, this review delineates the mechanisms of tumor immune escape and discusses different cancer immunotherapy regimens with their own advantages and setbacks, embracing challenges and perspectives in near future.

Phototherapy, a promising targeted therapy, eradicates primary tumors using an appropriate dosage of focal light irradiation, while initiating antitumor immune responses through induced immunogenic tumor cell death. Recently, phototherapy has been employed to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Phototherapy and immunoadjuvant therapy have been used in combination clinically, wherein the induced immunogenic cell death and enhanced antigen presentation synergy, inducing a systemic antitumor immune response to control residual tumor cells at the treatment site and distant metastases.

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, the emergence of effective immunotherapies has revolutionized the clinical management of many types of cancers. However, long-term durable tumour control is only achieved in a fraction of patients who receive these therapies. Understanding the mechanisms underlying clinical response and resistance to treatment is therefore essential to expanding the level of clinical benefit obtained from immunotherapies. In this Review, we describe the molecular mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation in tumours and their clinical consequences. We examine how various aspects of the antigen-presentation machinery (APM) shape tumour immunity. In particular, we discuss genomic variants in HLA alleles and other APM components, highlighting their influence on the immunopeptidomes of both malignant cells and immune cells. Understanding the APM, how it is regulated and how it changes in tumour cells is crucial for determining which patients will respond to immunotherapy and why some patients develop resistance. We focus on recently discovered molecular and genomic alterations that drive the clinical outcomes of patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors. An improved understanding of how these variables mediate tumour-immune interactions is expected to guide the more precise administration of immunotherapies and reveal potentially promising directions for the development of new immunotherapeutic approaches.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the acknowledged sex-related dimorphism in immune system response, little is known about the effect of patients' sex on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors as cancer treatments. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the heterogeneity of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy between men and women. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus, from database inception to Nov 30, 2017, for randomised controlled trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (inhibitors of PD-1, CTLA-4, or both) that had available hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to patients' sex. We also reviewed abstracts and presentations from all major conference proceedings. We excluded non-randomised trials and considered only papers published in English. The primary endpoint was to assess the difference in efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors between men and women, measured in terms of the difference in overall survival log(HR) reported in male and female study participants. We calculated the pooled overall survival HR and 95% CI in men and women using a random-effects model, and assessed the heterogeneity between the two estimates using an interaction test. FINDINGS: Of 7133 studies identified in our search, there were 20 eligible randomised controlled trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab) that reported overall survival according to patients' sex. Overall, 11 351 patients with advanced or metastatic cancers (7646 [67%] men and 3705 [33%] women) were included in the analysis; the most common types of cancer were melanoma (3632 [32%]) and non-small-cell lung cancer (3482 [31%]). The pooled overall survival HR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.65-0.79) in male patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, compared with men treated in control groups. In women treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the pooled overall survival HR compared with control groups was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.93). The difference in efficacy between men and women treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors was significant (p=0.0019). INTERPRETATION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve overall survival for patients with advanced cancers such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, but the magnitude of benefit is sex-dependent. Future research should guarantee greater inclusion of women in trials and focus on improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies in women, perhaps exploring different immunotherapeutic approaches in men and women.

However, primary and secondary resistances are encountered in most patients. Unravelling resistance mechanisms to cancer immunotherapies is an area of active investigation. Elevated levels of circulating enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) have been historically considered in oncology as a marker of bad prognosis, usually attributed to elevated tumour burden and cancer metabolism. Recent evidence suggests that elevated LDH levels could be independent from tumour burden and contain a negative predictive value, which could help in guiding treatment strategies in immuno-oncology. In this review, we decipher the rationale supporting the potential of LDH-targeted therapeutic strategies to tackle the direct immunosuppressive effects of LDH on a wide range of immune cells, and enhance the survival of patients treated with cancer immunotherapies.

      "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy utilizes the immune system to fight cancer and has already moved from the laboratory to clinical application. However, and despite excellent therapeutic outcomes in some hematological and solid cancers, the regular clinical use of cancer immunotherapies reveals major limitations. These include the lack of effective immune therapy options for some cancer types, unresponsiveness to treatment by many patients, evolving therapy resistance, the inaccessible and immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the risk of potentially life-threatening immune toxicities. Given the potential of nanotechnology to deliver, enhance, and fine-tune cancer immunotherapeutic agents, the combination of cancer immunotherapy with nanotechnology can overcome some of these limitations. In this review, we summarize innovative reports and novel strategies that successfully combine nanotechnology and cancer immunotherapy. We also provide insight into how nanoparticular combination therapies can be used to improve therapy responsiveness, to reduce unwanted toxicity, and to overcome adverse effects of the TME.

In tandem, new and confounding imaging characteristics have appeared that are distinct from those typically seen with conventional cytotoxic therapies. In fact, only 10% of patients on immunotherapy may show tumor shrinkage, typical of positive responses on conventional therapy. Conversely, those on immune therapies may initially demonstrate a delayed response, transient enlargement followed by tumor shrinkage, stable size, or the appearance of new lesions. New imaging response criteria such as the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) and immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) are being implemented in many trials. However, FDA approval of emerging therapies including immunotherapies still relies on the current RECIST criteria.

      "abstract": "Immune therapeutics are revolutionizing cancer treatments. In tandem, new and confounding imaging characteristics have appeared that are distinct from those typically seen with conventional cytotoxic therapies. In fact, only 10% of patients on immunotherapy may show tumor shrinkage, typical of positive responses on conventional therapy. Conversely, those on immune therapies may initially demonstrate a delayed response, transient enlargement followed by tumor shrinkage, stable size, or the appearance of new lesions. New imaging response criteria, such as the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) and immune-related Response Criteria (irRC), are being implemented in many trials. However, FDA approval of emerging therapies, including immunotherapies, still relies on the current RECIST criteria. In this chapter, we review the traditional and new imaging response criteria for evaluation of solid tumors and briefly touch on some of the more commonly associated immunotherapy-induced adverse events.

      "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging as potentially useful platforms in treatment methods for patients with tumors. They preferentially target and kill tumor cells, leaving healthy cells unharmed. In addition to direct oncolysis, the essential and attractive aspect of oncolytic virotherapy is based on the intrinsic induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses. To further augment this efficacious response, OVs have been genetically engineered to express immune regulators that enhance or restore antitumor immunity. Recently, combinations of OVs with other immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), have led to promising progress in cancer treatment. This review summarizes the intrinsic mechanisms of OVs, describes the optimization strategies for using armed OVs to enhance the effects of antitumor immunity and highlights rational combinations of OVs with other immunotherapies in recent preclinical and clinical studies.

The advent of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has not only revolutionized cancer therapy, but also spawned great interest in identifying predictive biomarkers, since only one third of patients show treatment response. The aging process extensively affects the adaptive immune system and thus T cells, which are the main target of ICB. In this review, we address age-related changes regarding the adaptive immune system with a focus on T cells and their implication on carcinogenesis and ICB. Differences between senescence, exhaustion, and anergy are defined and current knowledge, treatment strategies, and studies exploring T cell aging as a biomarker for ICB are discussed. Finally, novel approaches to improve immunotherapies and to identify biomarkers of response to ICB are presented and their potential is assessed in a comparative analysis.

In the past decade, the field of NK cell-based treatment has been accelerating exponentially, holding a dominant position in cancer immunotherapy innovation. Generally, research on NK cell-mediated antitumor therapies can be categorized into three areas: choosing the optimal source of allogeneic NK cells to yield massively amplified \"off-the-shelf\" products, improving NK cell cytotoxicity and longevity, and engineering NK cells with the ability of tumor-specific recognition. In this review, we focused on NK cell manufacturing techniques, some auxiliary methods to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of NK cells, chimeric antigen receptor NK cells, and monoclonal antibodies targeting inhibitory receptors, which can significantly augment the antitumor activity of NK cells. Notably, emerging evidence suggests that NK cells are a promising constituent of multipronged therapeutic strategies, strengthening immune responses to cancer.

Based on this knowledge, a series of new therapies collectively referred to as immunotherapies have been developed and translated to the clinic for treating cancer patients. Although some cancer subtypes have shown strong clinical responses, including curative outcomes in some patients, immunotherapies have not worked as desired for some subtypes and forms of cancers. We provide an overview of the transcriptional mechanisms that drive the response and resistance to immunotherapies. We also discuss possible interventions to enhance the outcomes of immunotherapies by targeting dysregulated transcriptional networks in cancer cells. CI - Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

      "research_insight": "This 2022 review article in *Trends in Cancer* by Gupta et al. is highly relevant to a researcher studying cancer immunotherapy because it focuses on the transcriptional mechanisms driving both response and resistance to these therapies. Specifically, the discussion of interventions targeting dysregulated transcriptional networks to enhance immunotherapy outcomes warrants further exploration, as this could lead to novel strategies for overcoming resistance. Given the increasing importance of personalized medicine, understanding the transcriptional landscape in relation to immunotherapy response is crucial for advancing the field and improving patient outcomes.\n"
