      "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malaria threatens the lives of over 200 million individuals with the disease each year. Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant cause of severe malaria which may be lethal and result in neurocognitive sequelae despite appropriate treatment. We review recent advances regarding the pathophysiology of severe malaria and treatment recommendations for severe disease in the United States. RECENT FINDINGS: Infected red blood cell (iRBC) sequestration in microvascular beds is a critical factor in the development of severe malaria syndromes. Interactions between iRBC variant adhesive peptides and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) result in perturbations of coagulation and cytopreservation pathways. Alterations in the protein C/EPCR axis are implicated in cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, and anemia. Brain MRIs reveal the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in cerebral malaria patients. Transcriptomic analysis reveals commonalities in disease pathogenesis in children and adults despite differences in clinical presentation. US guidelines for severe malaria treatment currently recommend intravenous artesunate including in pregnant women and children. SUMMARY: Despite advances in our understanding of malarial pathogenesis much remains unknown. Antimalarial agents eradicate parasites but no treatments are available to prevent or ameliorate severe malaria or prevent disease sequelae. Further study is needed to develop effective adjunctive therapies.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Malaria is caused by protozoa parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is diagnosed in approximately 2000 people in the US each year who have returned from visiting regions with endemic malaria. The mortality rate from malaria is approximately 0.3% in the US and 0.26% worldwide. OBSERVATIONS: In the US, most malaria is diagnosed in people who traveled to an endemic region. More than 80% of people diagnosed with malaria in the US acquired the infection in Africa. Of the approximately 2000 people diagnosed with malaria in the US in 2017, an estimated 82.4% were adults and about 78.6% were Black or African American. Among US residents diagnosed with malaria, 71.7% had not taken malaria chemoprophylaxis during travel. In 2017 in the US, P falciparum was the species diagnosed in approximately 79% of patients, whereas P vivax was diagnosed in an estimated 11.2% of patients. In 2017 in the US, severe malaria, defined as vital organ involvement including shock, pulmonary edema, significant bleeding, seizures, impaired consciousness, and laboratory abnormalities such as kidney impairment, acidosis, anemia, or high parasitemia, occurred in approximately 14% of patients, and an estimated 0.3% of those receiving a diagnosis of malaria in the US died. P falciparum has developed resistance to chloroquine in most regions of the world, including Africa. First-line therapy for P falciparum malaria in the US is combination therapy that includes artemisinin. If P falciparum was acquired in a known chloroquine-sensitive region such as Haiti, chloroquine remains an alternative option. When artemisinin-based combination therapies are not available, atovaquone-proguanil or quinine plus clindamycin is used for chloroquine-resistant malaria. P vivax, P ovale, P malariae, and P knowlesi are typically chloroquine sensitive, and treatment with either artemisinin-based combination therapy or chloroquine for regions with chloroquine-susceptible infections for uncomplicated malaria is recommended. For severe malaria, intravenous artesunate is first-line therapy. Treatment of mild malaria due to a chloroquine-resistant parasite consists of a combination therapy that includes artemisinin or chloroquine for chloroquine-sensitive malaria. P vivax and P ovale require additional therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline to eradicate the liver stage. Several options exist for chemoprophylaxis and selection should be based on patient characteristics and preferences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 2000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in the US, most commonly in travelers returning from visiting endemic areas. Prevention and treatment of malaria depend on the species and the drug sensitivity of parasites from the region of acquisition. Intravenous artesunate is first-line therapy for severe malaria.

      "abstract": "Increasing drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and a resurgence of malaria in tropical areas have effected a change in treatment of malaria in the last two decades. Symptoms of malaria are fever, chills, headache, and malaise. The prognosis worsens as the parasite counts, counts of mature parasites, and counts of neutrophils containing pigment increase. Treatment depends on severity, age of patient, degree of background immunity, likely pattern of susceptibility to antimalarial drugs, and the cost and availability of drugs. Chloroquine should be used for P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. P. vivax has shown high resistance to chloroquine in Oceania, however. Primaquine may be needed to treat P. vivax and P. ovale to rid the body of hypnozoites that survive in the liver. Chloroquine can treat P. falciparum infections acquired in North Africa, Central America north of the Panama Canal, Haiti, or the Middle East but not in most of Africa and some parts of Asia and South America. In areas of low grade resistance to chloroquine, amodiaquine can be used to effectively treat falciparum malaria. A combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is responsive to falciparum infections with high grade resistance to chloroquine. Mefloquine, halofantrine, or quinine with tetracycline can be used to treat multidrug-resistant P. falciparum. Derivatives of artemisinin obtained from qinghao or sweet wormwood developed as pharmaceuticals in China are the most rapidly acting of all antimalarial drugs. Children tend to tolerate antimalarial drugs well. Children who weigh less than 15 kg should not be given mefloquine. Health workers should not prescribe primaquine to pregnant women or newborns due to the risk of hemolysis. Chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, quinine, and quinidine can be safely given in therapeutic doses throughout pregnancy. Clinical manifestations of severe malaria are hypoglycemia, convulsions, severe anemia, acute renal failure, jaundice, pulmonary edema, cerebral malaria, shock, and acidosis. Health workers should be prepared to treat these symptoms accordingly.

      "abstract": "Malaria disproportionately affects children younger than 5 years. Falciparum malaria is responsible for more than 200 000 child deaths per year in Africa and vivax malaria is well documented as a cause of severe anaemia and excess mortality in children in Asia and Oceania. For the treatment of malaria in children, paediatric dosing recommendations for several agents, including parenteral artesunate and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, have belatedly been shown to be suboptimal. Worsening antimalarial resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in the Greater Mekong Subregion threatens to undermine global efforts to control malaria. Triple antimalarial combination therapies are being evaluated to try to impede this threat. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine gives partial protection against falciparum malaria and is being evaluated in large, pilot studies in Ghana, Malawi, and Kenya as a complementary tool to other preventive measures. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention in west Africa has resulted in declines in malaria incidence and deaths and there is interest in scaling up efforts by expanding the age range of eligible recipients. Preventing relapse in Plasmodium vivax infection with primaquine is challenging because treating children who have G6PD deficiency with primaquine can cause acute haemolytic anaemia. The safety of escalating dose regimens for primaquine is being studied to mitigate this risk. CI - Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In sub-Saharan Africa, CM occurs mainly in children under five years of age. Although intravenous artesunate is considered the preferred treatment for CM, the clinical efficacy is still far from satisfactory. The neurological damage induced by CM is irreversible and lethal, and it is therefore of great significance to unravel the exact etiology of CM, which may be beneficial for the effective management of this severe disease. Here, we review the clinical characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical therapy of CM, with the aim of providing insights into the development of novel tools for improved CM treatments.

      "abstract": "The deployment of artesunate for severe malaria and the artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) for uncomplicated malaria has been a major advance in antimalarial therapeutics. These drugs have reduced treated mortality, accelerated recovery and reduced treatment failure rates and transmission from the treated infection. Artemisinin derivatives remain highly effective against falciparum malaria in most malaria endemic areas, but significant resistance has emerged in the Greater Mekong subregion of Southeast Asia. Resistance to artemisinins was followed by resistance to the ACT partner drugs, and fit multidrug resistant parasite lineages have now spread widely across the region. ACTs remain highly effective against P. vivax and the other malaria species. Recent studies have shown that radical curative regimens of primaquine (to prevent relapse) can be shortened to 7 days, and that the newly introduced single dose tafenoquine is an alternative, although the currently recommended dose is insufficient in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Targeted malaria elimination using focal mass treatments with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine have proved safe and effective malaria elimination accelerators, but progress overall towards malaria elimination is slow. Indeed since 2015 overall malaria case numbers globally have risen. As new drugs will not become widely available in the near future, active measures to preserve the current antimalarials should be given the highest priority. CI - (c) 2020 The Authors.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection, particularly affecting children under the age of 5 years in Africa. Current treatment with parenteral artemisinin derivatives is highly efficacious. However, artemisinin partial resistance is widespread in Southeast Asia, resulting in delayed parasite clearance after therapy, and has emerged independently in South America, Oceania, and Africa. Hence, new treatments for severe malaria are needed, and it is prudent to define their characteristics now. This manuscript focuses on the target product profile (TPP) for new treatments for severe malaria. It also highlights preparedness when considering ways of protecting the utility of artemisinin-based therapies. TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE: Severe malaria treatments must be highly potent, with rapid onset of antiparasitic activity to clear the infection as quickly as possible to prevent complications. They should also have a low potential for drug resistance selection, given the high parasite burden in patients with severe malaria. Combination therapies are needed to deter resistance selection and dissemination. Partner drugs which are approved for uncomplicated malaria treatment would provide the most rapid development pathway for combinations, though new candidate molecules should be considered. Artemisinin combination approaches to severe malaria would extend the lifespan of current therapy, but ideally, completely novel, non-artemisinin-based combination therapies for severe malaria should be developed. These should be advanced to at least phase 2 clinical trials, enabling rapid progression to patient use should current treatment fail clinically. New drug combinations for severe malaria should be available as injectable formulations for rapid and effective treatment, or as rectal formulations for pre-referral intervention in resource-limited settings. CONCLUSION: Defining the TPP is a key step to align responses across the community to proactively address the potential for clinical failure of artesunate in severe malaria. In the shorter term, artemisinin-based combination therapies should be developed using approved or novel drugs. In the longer term, novel combination treatments should be pursued. Thus, this TPP aims to direct efforts to preserve the efficacy of existing treatments while improving care and outcomes for individuals affected by this life-threatening disease. CI - (c) 2024.

      "abstract": "Although global morbidity and mortality have decreased substantially, malaria, a parasite infection of red blood cells, still kills roughly 2000 people per day, most of whom are children in Africa. Two factors largely account for these decreases; increased deployment of insecticide-treated bednets and increased availability of highly effective artemisinin combination treatments. In large trials, parenteral artesunate (an artemisinin derivative) reduced severe malaria mortality by 22.5% in Africa and 34.7% in Asia compared with quinine, whereas adjunctive interventions have been uniformly unsuccessful. Rapid tests have been an important addition to microscopy for malaria diagnosis. Chemopreventive strategies have been increasingly deployed in Africa, notably intermittent sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment in pregnancy, and monthly amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during the rainy season months in children aged between 3 months and 5 years across the sub-Sahel. Enthusiasm for malaria elimination has resurfaced. This ambitious but laudable goal faces many challenges, including the worldwide economic downturn, difficulties in elimination of vivax malaria, development of pyrethroid resistance in some anopheline mosquitoes, and the emergence of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in southeast Asia. We review the epidemiology, clinical features, pathology, prevention, and treatment of malaria. CI - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The parasite is indistinguishable by microscopy from the more benign P. malariae, but can result in high parasitaemias with multiorgan failure, and deaths have been reported. Recognition of severe knowlesi malaria, and prompt initiation of effective therapy is therefore essential to prevent adverse outcomes. Here we review all studies reporting treatment of uncomplicated and severe knowlesi malaria. We report that although chloroquine is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated knowlesi malaria, artemisinin combination treatment is associated with faster parasite clearance times and lower rates of anaemia during follow-up, and should be considered the treatment of choice, particularly given the risk of administering chloroquine to drug-resistant P. vivax or P. falciparum misdiagnosed as P. knowlesi malaria in co-endemic areas. For severe knowlesi malaria, intravenous artesunate has been shown to be highly effective and associated with reduced case-fatality rates, and should be commenced without delay. Regular paracetamol may also be considered for patients with severe knowlesi malaria or for those with acute kidney injury, to attenuate the renal damage resulting from haemolysis-induced lipid peroxidation.

      "research_insight": "This article is highly relevant to the researcher's query on severe malaria treatment because it specifically reviews the clinical management of *Plasmodium knowlesi* malaria, including treatment strategies for both uncomplicated and severe cases. The paper highlights the effectiveness of intravenous artesunate for severe *knowlesi* malaria and suggests paracetamol as a potential adjunct therapy for kidney injury, which warrants further investigation into the mechanisms and optimal dosage of paracetamol in this context. Given the increasing prevalence of *P. knowlesi* and its potential for severe outcomes, this review contributes significantly to the field by providing updated treatment recommendations and highlighting areas for future research in managing this emerging parasitic disease.\n"
