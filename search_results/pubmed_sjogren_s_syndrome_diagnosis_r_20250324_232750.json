      "abstract": "Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by ocular and oral dryness resulting from lacrimal and salivary gland dysfunction. Besides, a variety of systemic manifestations may occur, involving virtually any organ system. As a result, the disease is characterized by pleomorphic clinical manifestations whose characteristics and severity may vary greatly from one patient to another. Sjogren's syndrome can be defined as primary or secondary, depending on whether it occurs alone or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, respectively. The pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome is still elusive, nevertheless, different, not mutually exclusive, models involving genetic and environmental factors have been proposed to explain its development. Anyhow, the emergence of aberrant autoreactive B-lymphocytes, conducting to autoantibody production and immune complex formation, seems to be crucial in the development of the disease. The diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, as well as on specific tests including salivary gland histopathology and autoantibodies. Recently, new classification criteria and disease activity scores have been developed primarily for research purposes and they can also be useful tools in everyday clinical practice. Treatment of Sjogren's syndrome ranges from local and symptomatic therapies aimed to control dryness to systemic medications, including disease-modifying agents and biological drugs. The objective of this review paper is to summarize the recent literature on Sjogren's syndrome, starting from its pathogenesis to current therapeutic options. CI - (c) 2021. The Author(s).

      "abstract": "Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated injury of exocrine glands. Extensive lymphocytic infiltrates may contribute to the destruction and loss of secretory function of glands. B-cell hyperactivity is a key feature of the disease resulting in the production of a diverse array of autoantibodies in these patients. Although not specific for SS, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies have been useful biomarkers for disease classification and diagnosis. During recent years, novel autoantibodies have been discovered in SS. In this review, we summarize the historical role and clinical relevance that autoantibodies have played in the classification criteria of Sjogren's syndrome, discuss laboratory aspects in antibody detection and review the role of novel autoantibodies in predicting particular stages of the disease, clinical phenotypes and long-term complications.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of present paper is to critically address the recent advances on diagnostic procedures of Sjogren's syndrome, taking into account the attained local and systemic features of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the available literature regarding to the diagnostic approaches to Sjogren's syndrome was conducted. Eligible studies were identified by searching the electronic literature PubMed, Medline, Embase, and ScienceDirect databases for relevant reports (last search update January 2012) combining the MESH heading term \"Sjogren's syndrome\", with the words \"diagnosis, diagnostic procedures, salivary gland function, ocular tests, histopathology, salivary gland imaging, serology\". The authors checked the references of the selected articles to identify additional eligible publications and contacted the authors, if necessary. RESULTS: Presented article addresses the established diagnostic criteria for Sjogren's syndrome and critically evaluates the most commonly used diagnostic procedures, presenting data from author's own clinical experience. Diagnostic criteria for Sjogren's syndrome are required both by healthcare professionals and patients, namely in order to provide a rational basis for the assessment of the symptoms, establish an individual disease prognosis, and orientate the therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Sjogren's syndrome is quite a common autoimmune disease of which the diagnosis and treatment are not easily established. Due to its systemic involvement, it can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations that contribute to confusion and delay in diagnosis. The use of proper diagnostic modalities will help to reduce the time to diagnosis and preserve the health and quality of life of patients with Sjogren's syndrome.

In this review, we summarize recent advancements in SS diagnostics, treatments, and our understanding of correlations between oral and ocular manifestations of SS. Google Scholar and PubMed databases were utilized to search peer-reviewed papers since 2016 on SS diagnosis, treatment, and correlations between oral and ocular manifestations. For diagnostics, we discuss the updated SS classification criteria by the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR), new biomarkers, and compare studies of current diagnostic methods with alternative technologies. For treatments, we discuss topical, systemic, and surgical treatment developments in the management of oral and ocular symptoms of SS as there is still no cure for the disorder. Finally, we report studies that directly suggest correlations between the ocular surface disease and oral disease in SS, as well as shared abnormalities in the microbiome and cytokine expression that may be correlated. We conclude by stating limitations to our review as well as paths moving forward. Elucidating correlations between oral and ocular manifestations may be the key to furthering our understanding of SS pathogenesis as well as defining new standards for diagnosis and treatment.

      "abstract": "Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder in which lymphocytic infiltration leads to lacrimal and salivary glands dysfunction, which results in symptoms of dryness (xerophthalmia and xerostomia). Extraglandular features are common and may affect several organs. Renal involvement has long been known as one of the systemic complications of pSS. The most classical lesion observed in pSS is tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and less frequently membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), which is related to cryoglobulinemia. In some cases, renal biopsy is necessary for the definitive diagnosis of kidney involvement. Patients may present with proximal renal tubular acidosis, distal renal tubular acidosis and chronic kidney disease. Response to treatment is usually favorable. However, occasionally severe and rarely lethal outcomes have been described. Recently, several case series and cross-sectional studies have been published which investigated the factors associated with renal involvement in pSS and the most accurate screening tests for early detection. The presence of xerophthalmia, anti-SSA and rheumatoid factor positivity, low C3 levels and other features have all shown either positive or inverse associations with the development of renal complications. Serum creatinine, alpha-1-microglobulin, cystatin-C have been evaluated as early detection biomarkers with variable accuracy. More advanced techniques may be necessary to confirm proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis, along with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The aim of the current paper is to summarize and critically examine these findings in order to provide updated guidance on serum biomarkers and further testing for kidney involvement in pSS.

      "abstract": "With the recent advancement in omics and molecular techniques, a wealth of new molecular biomarkers have become available for the diagnosis and classification of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) patients. However, whether these biomarkers are universal is of great interest to us. In this study, we used various methods to obtain shared biomarkers derived from multiple tissue in pSS patients and to explore their relationship with immune microenvironment alterations. First we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pSS and healthy controls utilizing nine mRNA microarray datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then, shared biomarkers were filtered out using robust rank aggregation (RRA), data integration analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) regression; their roles in pSS and association with changes in the immune microenvironment were also analyzed. In addition, these biomarkers were further confirmed with both the testing set and immunohistochemistry (IHC). As a result, ten biomarkers, i.e., EPSTI1, IFI44, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, MX1, OAS1, PARP9, SAMD9L and TRIM22, were identified. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the ten genes could discriminate pSS from controls. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the enrichment of immune-related gene sets was significant in pSS patients with high expression of either biomarker. Furthermore, the association between some immunocytes and these biomarkers was identified. In the two distinct molecular patterns of pSS patients based on the expressions of these biomarkers, the proportions of immunocytes were significantly different. Our study identified shared biomarkers of multi-tissue origin and revealed their relationship with altered immune microenvironment in pSS patients. These markers not only have diagnostic implications but also provide potential immunotherapeutic targets for the clinical treatment of pSS patients. CI - Copyright (c) 2023 Elsevier GmbH.

Although systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome were previously considered two forms of the same disease because of presence of clinical coexistence of these two conditions, the view that they are two different conditions with mutual characteristics has become prominent in recent years. In this paper, we reported a 16 year-old girl who was followed up with a diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome for six years and then was observed to have overlap of systemic lupus erythematosus. In the baseline, she did not have any clinical or serological evidence for systemic lupus erythematosus. After six year, massive proteinuria and serological findings developed and systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis was diagnosed by kidney biopsy. Currently, systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome cannot be differentiated definetely. We need more valuable diagnostic and classification criteria to differentiate these two important conditions.

      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Laminin-332 is an important component of the basement membrane. Recently, autoantibodies to Laminin-332 have been described in several autoimmune diseases. Many of these autoimmune diseases have a high incidence of malignancy. The importance of Laminin-332 autoantibodies and its relationship to malignancy is highlighted by using Laminin-332 Pemphigoid (LM-332Pg) as a prototype. OBJECTIVE: To identify several autoimmune diseases that have autoantibodies to Laminin-332 present, and to determine the prevalence of malignancy in them. Using Laminin-332 Pemphigoid (LM-332Pg) as a prototype, to compare clinical profiles of LM-332Pg patients with and without cancer. By identifying the temporal detection of cancer, can the influence of autoantibodies to Laminin-332 on prognosis be determined. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A literature search was conducted to identify autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in which autoantibodies to Laminin-332 were present. Subsequently, the rate of malignancy in these autoimmune diseases was determined. A search for publications on LM-332Pg patients to determine cancer rates and clinical outcomes to examine if a relationship can be proposed, was performed. FINDINGS: Autoantibodies to Laminin-332 were detected in recent studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), graft-vs-host disease (GVH), bullous pemphigoid (BP), lichen planus (LP), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), and membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN). A high incidence of cancer rate was reported in these autoimmune diseases including primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), systemic sclerosis (SS), dermatomyositis (DM), multiple sclerosis (MS), immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Data analysis demonstrated that LM-332Pg patients had a higher risk of developing ovarian, uterine, lung, gastric cancers and leukemia. The incidence for breast cancer was lower, when compared with global cancer rates. Patients diagnosed with cancer after the presence of LM-332Pg had higher rates of mortality and lower rates of remission, compared to those diagnosed with cancer prior to the discovery/diagnosis of LM-332Pg. When studied, levels of Laminin-332 autoantibodies correlated with the presence or absence of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preliminary analysis suggests that autoantibodies to Laminin-332 are present in multiple autoimmune diseases, which also have a high incidence of malignancy. Detailed analysis of available data highlights that patients who developed LM-332Pg after cancer was diagnosed, had a more favorable prognosis, compared to patients who developed cancer when LM-332Pg was previously present. Preliminary data would suggest that autoantibodies to Laminin-332 could serve as an important biomarker in certain patients, for correlation with possible incidence of malignancy.

The development of internationally approved criteria for the classification and diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome has been a major scientific task for nearly two decades with consensus now approaching. In contrast, an international dialogue on how to develop additional common criteria for the assessment of disease activity, organ damage and outcome in Sjogren's syndrome has just recently been initiated. Such assessment criteria would provide useful measures for patient management and are mandatory for comparing efficacy between different clinical trials. The lack of common assessment criteria may be explained by missing uniform diagnostic criteria, by the multispeciality and systemic nature of the disease and the difficulties in separating out what is activity and what is damage in Sjogren's syndrome. Attempts are now made to overcome these problems. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief introduction to the concepts of disease activity, damage and outcome in Sjogren's syndrome with reference to the results obtained from a recent workshop on assessment tools in Sjogren's syndrome held in Oxford, England in March 2000.

      "research_insight": "This 2001 paper by Asmussen is relevant to the researcher's query on recent Sjogren's Syndrome diagnosis papers because it discusses the development of internationally approved criteria for the classification and diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. While not a recent paper, it highlights the historical challenges in establishing uniform diagnostic criteria and the ongoing need for assessment tools for disease activity, organ damage, and outcome. The discussion of the Oxford workshop on assessment tools in Sjogren's syndrome held in March 2000 deserves further exploration to understand the specific assessment methods being considered at that time and how they influenced subsequent diagnostic approaches. This paper provides valuable context for understanding the evolution of diagnostic criteria and the complexities of assessing disease activity in Sjogren's Syndrome.\n"
