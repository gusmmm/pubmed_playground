      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is a high unmet need for safe and effective non-opioid medicines to treat moderate to severe pain without risk of addiction. Voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na(V)1.8) is a genetically and pharmacologically validated pain target that is selectively expressed in peripheral pain-sensing neurons and not in the central nervous system (CNS). Suzetrigine (VX-548) is a potent and selective inhibitor of Na(V)1.8, which has demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in multiple acute pain studies. Our study was designed to characterize the mechanism of action of suzetrigine and assess both nonclinical and clinical data to test the hypothesis that selective Na(V)1.8 inhibition translates into clinical efficacy and safety, including lack of addictive potential. METHODS: Preclinical pharmacology and mechanism of action studies were performed in vitro using electrophysiology and radiolabeled binding methods in cells recombinantly expressing human Na(V) channels, human proteins, and primary human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. Safety and addictive potential assessments included in vitro secondary pharmacology studies, nonclinical repeat-dose toxicity and dependence studies in rats and/or monkeys, and a systematic analysis of adverse event data generated from 2447 participants from phase 3 acute pain studies of suzetrigine. RESULTS: Suzetrigine is selective against all other Na(V) subtypes (>/= 31,000-fold) and 180 other molecular targets. Suzetrigine inhibits Na(V)1.8 by binding to the protein's second voltage sensing domain (VSD2) to stabilize the closed state of the channel. This novel allosteric mechanism results in tonic inhibition of Na(V)1.8 and reduces pain signals in primary human DRG sensory neurons. Nonclinical and clinical safety assessments with suzetrigine demonstrate no adverse CNS, cardiovascular or behavioral effects and no evidence of addictive potential or dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive pharmacology assessment presented here indicates that suzetrigine represents the first in a new class of non-opioid analgesics that are selective Na(V)1.8 pain signal inhibitors acting in the peripheral nervous system to safely treat pain without addictive potential.

Because suzetrigine is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins and its active metabolite is more than 96% protein bound, the amounts in milk are likely to be low. If the mother requires suzetrigine, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. However, until more data become available, an alternate drug may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

      "abstract": "Opioids are commonly prescribed for the management of moderate to severe pain, but their use is associated with dependency and other adverse effects. For decades, the development of safe and effective non-addictive alternatives for treating moderate to severe pain has seen limited progress. On January 30, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved suzetrigine, the first Nav1.8 inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. Nav1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel that is selectively expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons, which are responsible for transmitting pain signals. By highly selectively inhibiting the Nav1.8 channel, suzetrigine can effectively alleviate pain. Unlike opioids, this drug does not induce euphoria or excitement in the brain, thereby eliminating concerns about addiction. Suzetrigine offers a novel therapeutic option and a potential combination for multimodal analgesia, with the promise of transforming acute pain management and establishing new treatment standards.

      "abstract": "Acute pain, defined as short-term pain arising from injury or other noxious stimuli, affects patient outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare costs. Safe, effective treatment of acute pain is essential in preventing increased morbidity, mortality, and the transition to chronic pain. In this review, we explore some of the latest therapeutic agents, formulations, combinations, and administration routes of drugs emerging in clinical practice in the USA for the treatment of acute pain. These agents include VX-548 (Suzetrigine), Cebranopadol, AAT-076, Combogesic intravenous (IV), sublingual ketamine, XG004 (naproxen/pregabalin conjugate), and HTX-011 (Zynrelef). We analyze the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, development status, and clinical implications of these drugs, emphasizing the importance of finding an agent that provides both a strong safety profile and effective relief from acute pain. Our findings show promise but also highlight the need for further large-scale research to allow these drugs to be utilized in a clinical context for patients experiencing acute pain. CI - (c) 2024.
