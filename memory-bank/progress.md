## Known Issues
- None currently tracked

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. API Rate Limiting
   - Status: To be addressed
   - Mitigation: Implement robust rate limiting

2. Cross-Source Data Consistency
   - Status: Design phase
   - Mitigation: Standardized data models

3. Performance at Scale
   - Status: To be evaluated
   - Mitigation: Cache-first approach

## Next Actions
1. Implement base class structure
2. Set up testing framework
3. Create first adapter (PubMed)
4. Implement error handling
5. Add basic documentation

## Future Considerations
- Performance optimization
- Additional data sources
- Advanced caching strategies
- Batch processing capabilities
- API versioning support
