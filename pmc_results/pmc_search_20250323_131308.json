      "abstract": "The utilization of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is critical in the preoperative planning phase of brain tumor surgery because it allows for a delicate balance between maximizing tumor resection and maintaining brain function. A decade of fMRI development was examined in this study, with a particular emphasis on its use in diagnosing and assessing the efficacy of brain cancer treatments. We examined the foundational principles, practical implementations, and verification of fMRI via direct brain stimulation, with particular emphasis on its capacity to detect cerebral regions affected by tumors that are eloquent in nature. Recently, fMRI has undergone significant progress, allowing for its integration into clinical workflows to facilitate precise mapping of brain functions. This extensive analysis encompasses the scrutiny of resting-state fMRI (Rs-fMRI) as a method of capturing functional connectivity, thereby providing significant insights into the management of patients with brain tumors. Methodological advancements, clinical applicability, and future orientations of fMRI are highlighted in this review, which emphasizes the substantial influence of the technique on neurosurgical planning and patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia patients frequently present with structural and functional abnormalities of the hippocampus (Hipp). Further, these abnormalities are often associated with specific symptom profiles. Aim To determine whether schizophrenia patients show specific functional connectivity (FC) and activity abnormalities in each hippocampal subregion compared to the BD (bipolar disorder) and HC (healthy control) groups. Methods Basal activation state and functional connectivity (FC) in four subregions of the bilateral Hipp were examined: left caudal (cHipp_L), right caudal (cHipp_R), left rostral (rHipp_L), and right rostral (rHipp_R). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were obtained from 62 schizophrenia patients, 57 bipolar disorder (BD) patients, and 45 healthy controls (HCs), and analyzed for fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) as a measure of basal neural activity and for whole-brain FC based on the hippocampal subregions. Results The schizophrenia group exhibited greater fALFF in bilateral cHipp (the caudal part of hippocampus) and rHipp (the rostral part of hippocampus) subregions compared to BD and HC groups as well as increased FC between the bilateral cHipp and multiple brain regions, including the thalamus, putamen, middle frontal gyrus, parietal cortex, and precuneus. Moreover, fALFF values of the bilateral cHipp were positively correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Conclusions These findings confirm an important contribution of hippocampal dysfunction, especially of the cHipp, in schizophrenia. Further, hyper-connectivity and hyperactivity of the cHipp could serve as a biomarker for therapeutic development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Adolescent alcohol use is the norm, but only some develop a substance use disorder (SUD). The most common vulnerability traits are characterized by diverse externalizing (EXT) behaviors (e.g., poor impulse-control and emotion regulation). Preliminary studies suggest that this increased risk may be influenced by altered mesocorticolimbic processing of drug and non-drug reward-related cues. The effects are complex. Whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measured responses to alcohol cues are elevated in young adults with an alcohol use disorder compared to healthy drinkers (1), high-risk youth who have not developed an SUD are reported to poorly differentiate cues associated with high vs low reward; e.g., monetary reward (2). Aims &amp; Objectives Measure brain activation responses to alcohol and non-alcohol cues in high- vs low- EXT youth who have been followed since birth. Method Seventy-one longitudinally followed young social drinkers (age 18.5&#xB1;0.6) underwent fMRI scans and completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 11), Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS), and Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activations were measured while participants received 1ml beverage tastants consisting of their preferred alcohol beverage, their preferred fruit juice, and water. Fourteen participants were excluded due to image quality issues, resulting in a final sample of 57, 27 high EXT (15F/12M) and 30 low EXT (20F/10M). As previously reported, most of these participants also had [18F]fallypride (47/57) and [11C]ABP688 (47/57) positron emission tomography scans and the high EXT group exhibited widespread increases in dopamine DRD2/3 receptors (3) and decreases in type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptors (4). Results As anticipated, high vs low EXT participants had higher AUDIT scores, alcohol binge occasions, lifetime uses of cannabis, impulsivity scores (SURPS and BIS-11), and prevalence of psychiatric disorders (mostly mood, anxiety, ADHD, and mild SUDs). For the alcohol (vs water) fMRI contrast, both groups exhibited activations in the thalamus, but only the high EXT group had significant activations in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, right calcarine, and post central gyrus. Significant group differences, in comparison, were only seen when contrasting the two flavored reward cues, alcohol vs juice. Whereas the low EXT group exhibited larger mesocorticolimbic BOLD responses to alcohol (vs water) than juice (vs water), these responses were undifferentiated in the high EXT group. Discussion &amp; Conclusion The results add to the evidence that, in high-risk youth, mesocorticolimbic activations poorly distinguish reward-related cues, extending this observation to alcohol vs juice. The neurotransmitters mediating these responses remain unknown, but disrupted differentiations of reward- related cues might erode the ability to make optimal choices, increasing the risk for SUDs and their commonly comorbid conditions.
